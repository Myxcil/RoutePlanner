# RoutePlanner

Tool for OnAir jobs. If you want to run multiple jobs, add them to the list. Click 'Search' to find the "shortest" route around. 
Doesn't take cargo or passenger limits into account (yet). 

I wrote this because of several missions that had airports close to each other and I was too lazy to do this by hand :)

Airport data was downloaded from https://openflights.org/data.html. Possibly not all airports from OnAir available.

Install:
1. Download zip from https://github.com/Myxcil/RoutePlanner/releases 
2. Unpack zip where you want to install the RoutePlanner
3. Run 'Routeplanner.exe'
